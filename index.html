          <strong>Toppers pizza Driver </strong> – Toppers  
          Working at Toppers, I am responsible for ensuring that all dressings, sides, and pizzas are delivered 
          as quickly as possible while still following the rules of the road. I am also responsible for restocking 
          cheese, peppers, and ranch, so we always have some in hand. Skills I use working here are connecting with the 
          customer who is receiving their pizza, making sure they have a good experience with our service.
          I also worked at Taco Bell for around four years as an assistant manager and learned the most about the importance of keeping
          track of money and inventory.
